# Expo Camera.getStatusAsync is not a function

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with the Expo Camera API and provides a solution.

## Problem

The error message `Camera.getStatusAsync is not a function` arises when you attempt to use methods of the `Camera` component before it's fully initialized.

## Solution

The solution involves using `async/await` to ensure that `Camera.getStatusAsync()` is called only after the `Camera` component is ready.  This requires handling the promise returned by `Camera.getStatusAsync()` to check the camera's status before accessing its features.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
